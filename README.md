## Installation 
1. clone the repo
2. open the GoogleService-Info.plist file form the project. If you want to use your own firebase system, go for it. If you wants mine go to the next step.
3. go to [this link](https://gist.github.com/mehdihasan/f87115782df1fc00236f57e528fa2046), copy the content and paste it to the GoogleService-Info.plist file.
4. run the following command:
